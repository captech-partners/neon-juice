Rapid Website Creation Studio is an interactive web application that provides a new way of website creation. Instead of creating a "one fits all" general-purpose website, users can create fully customized content for each visitor. This project assists non-technical users with creating and maintaining HTML fragments. These fragments can then be dynamically rendered and assemble a webpage based on the content labels. With the userâ€™s specifications, our implementation of dynamic components allows for a more personalized user experience, resulting in websites with higher levels of engagement.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
