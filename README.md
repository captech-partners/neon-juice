Reactful is a SaaS application that dynamically changes the users' web experience by injecting Web content based on onsite user behavior (digital body language) while navigating any customized websites. In the project, the team designed a new paradigm for creating and generating dynamic websites to leverage Reactful’s capabilities. The team constructed a flexible, generalized, and minimally invasive fragmentation of HTML and templates and an API based dynamic web page creator service. The service efficiently assembles the fragments into webpages for desktop and mobile devices, and the process is deterministic by navigation, templates, and user ‘s behavior. The end objective is for web pages to be dynamically and efficiently assembled on request while supporting a wide range of content layouts.
